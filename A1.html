<p>Hi, I'm Chakrya (<em>pronounced Chalk-re-ya.</em>)!  I am in the Web Design program, which I plan on completing Summer Quarter.  After the program, my goal is to build my portfolio and find employement in the UX industry.  I'm hoping knowing how to code will give me a competitive edge over other applicants.</p>

<p>I grew up on the Eastside but now reside in Seattle.  I have twin boys who have ruled my world for the last  3.5 years.  Prior to having kids, I snowshoed, hiked, tried out new restaurants with friends, and traveled domestically and internationally.  Nowadays when I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my boys and watching them discover the world.</p>
